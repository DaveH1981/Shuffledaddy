<p>Hello there, and welcome to my page on being a cat companion. Some may refer to caring for and enjoying the company of a cat
as ownership, but I prefer the term companionship. While being a companion requires a considerable amount of responibility, the 
reward is beyond description. Most cat companions consider their pets a part of the family, and I am one of them. On this page,
you may have noticed pictures of an orange and white male tabby. His name is Morris, and he has greatly enriched my life since I adopted
him in February 2011. Morris will turn two years old in June 2012, and he is very active.</p>

<h2>So you'd like to have a cat?</h2>

<p>If you've never had a cat before, but have always been curious, you've come to the right place. The purpose of this page is to 
educate prospective cat companions on the basics of caring for your feline friend. At the end, there is a page with Web addresses 
and information on various shelters and rescue agencies. I hope you enjoy your stay and find some useful information. Have fun!</p>
