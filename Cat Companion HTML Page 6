<h2>Some Benefits of Cat Companionship</h2>

<h3><em>Cats are Comforting</em></h3>

<p>Having a cat as your companion can greatly enrich your life and give you a valuable friend. Also, having a pet cat in your household can 
be very relaxing and comforting. Some studies have shown that people who have animals in their home live longer and report fewer feelings of
loneliness than those who don't. A cat will love you unconditionally and always cherish the quality time you spend playing with or grooming her.
You can also talk to your cat and she will listen patiently, not judging you. This may sound weird to some people, but many cat companions confide
in their furry friends, especially things that they do not feel comfortable talking to other people about. However you choose to bond with your cat,
make sure she is happy and feels loved.</p>

<h3><em>A Special Holiday Guest</em></h3>

<p>While the holidays can be a very stressful time of year, having a cat can help ease some of the pressure and give you a fun companion. Cats love
the holiday season, as there are various decorations that stimulate their senses. There are green trees, bright lights, shiny wrapping paper, and 
smooth velvet stockings, just to name a few. Also, some cats (like my pal Morris, pictured) love boxes and all of the items associated with 
holiday gift-giving. Although it is always important to supervise your cat when playing, this goes double during the holiday season. Cats can get 
into all kinds of trouble, although most of it is benign, such as batting ornaments off of the tree. However, there are much more grave risks, such
as poisoning and electrocution, if your cat is allowed to play unsupervised during the holidays. Certain seasonal flowers such as Poinsettias and Easter
Lilies are poisonous, and some cats like to chew on electrical cords. If you watch your kitty at all times when she is playing, the two of you should
have many great holiday memories together.</p>

<h3><em>Cats and Kids</em></h3>

<p>Having a cat can teach a child respect for animals, responsibility, and the value of companionship. Cats and children can share a wonderful bond, but please keep a few things in mind.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show your child how to handle cats properly. This will help prevent frightening the animal as well as help your child earn your cat's trust.</li>
	<li>Explain your cat's behaviors as well as some pertinent facts. This will help the child understand more about the cat.</li>
	<li>Do not allow your child to play rough with the cat. Preventing roughhousing will help keep both your cat and your child safe.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child understands the importance of sleep and that cats sleep most of the day. Additionally, tell your little one never to disturb an animal
who is sleeping or eating.</li>
	<li>Perhaps most of important of all, be sure to model proper behavior at all times. This way, children will receive clear, consistent messages about how
to treat animals properly.</li>
</ul>
