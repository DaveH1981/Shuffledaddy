<h2>Beginnings(Pre-1980)</h2>

<p>Indie and punk rock trace their origins to 1960's garage rock and what has recently been termed "protopunk". Some examples of these late 60's-early 70's acts
are: The Velvet Underground (pictured), The Stooges, MC5, New York Dolls, Roxy Music, Alice Cooper, and Captain Beefheart. Much like the indie and punk
bands they inspired, there was not a single common thread between them other than they tended to favor a rawer and more experimental sound than the more
commercial artists of their day. This stripped-down approach to rock music did not go unnoticed by first-wave punk bands such as The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones,
Television, and Wire. These early punk rock bands were a large influence on the burgeoning hardcore punk scene that began in the United States around the late 1970's. Also of
note were more artistic bands called "post-punk", who were inspired by punk rock but usually made music that was more sophisticated and complex. Some examples of these bands
are Gang of Four, Public Image Limited, Joy Division, Talking Heads, and Mission of Burma.</p>


<h2>1980's</h2>

<p>The first half of the 1980's was dominated by hardcore punk music, which had its origins in late 1970's America. This new brand of punk rock was much faster, heavier, and
more aggressive than earlier styles. Instead of vocals being sung or snarled, they were often screamed or shouted. Many bands adopted the mantra "harder, faster, louder," and 
tried to take the new genre to extremes never heard before in rock music. Early practitioners of the style were Bad Brains, Minor Threat (Both Washington, D.C.-based), Black
Flag, and The Middle Class (both Southern California-based). Also, this period in the early-80's saw a marked rise in the founding of independent labels. This was something of
a necessity,  since this new music was considered by the major labels to be too extreme to have any commercial potential. This resulted in the proliferation of notable indie labels like 
SST (pictured), Taang! Records, Dischord, and Alternative Tentacles.</p> 



<p>By the mid-80's, many bands tired of playing by-the-book hardcore and began incorporating other styles of music into their songwriting. Some examples of these styles would
be country, funk, jazz, soul, rockabilly, and power pop. In 1984, several landmark independent records were released. The best known of these are Minutemen's <em>Double Nickels on the Dime</em>, 
The Replacements' <em>Let it Be</em>, Husker Du's <em>Zen Arcade</em>, and Meat Puppets' <em>Meat Puppets II</em>. These records were praised by fans and critics alike, and mainstream publications 
such as <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave them highly favorable reviews. These watershed albums paved the way for newer acts in the latter half of the decade, such as Sonic Youth, Big Black, Scratch
Acid, and Dinosaur Jr. By the end of the 80's, many major labels were paying more attention to the indie rock circuit and began signing bands. The Twin Cities' Husker Du and The Replacements
started the trend in the mid-80's by signing with Warner Bros. and Sire, respectively. Other notable bands that had signed with a major label by the early-90's were Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr,
Nirvana, Soundgarden, and fIREHOSE.</p>



<h2>1990's</h2>

<p>The 1990's are best known as the decade that brought alternative rock to the masses, but there were many bands releasing great music on independent labels during
this time. While bands such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Red Hot Chili Peppers were bands that had modest success on indie labels, they chose to sign with major labels in order to reach a
wider audience. This coincided with the "grunge" explosion of the early 90's, when it seemed every new band on MTV was wearing flannel shirts and torn jeans. However, not all rock bands of 
note during the decade were on major labels. Stockton, California-based Pavement(pictured) released several critically-acclaimed albums and became arguably the driving force of indie rock during the 90's.
Their 1991 album <em>Slanted and Enchanted</em> is often considered their magnum opus and regularly appears on 90's best-of album lists. Another band of note was Sebadoh, which was founded by Lou Barlow, 
former Dinosaur Jr bassist, and Eric Gaffney. While his former band chose to sign with a major label after his departure, Barlow and his bandmates decided to stay on indie labels and released noteworthy 
albums on labels such as Homestead and Sub Pop. 1994's <em>Bakesale</em> was especially well-received.</p>

<p>Also of note during the 90's is the Riot Grrrl scene, which was concentrated in the Pacific Northwest and Washington, D.C. area. While "grunge" was experiencing mainstream popularity, these 
predominantly female bands challenged the male-dominated "alternative" and punk scene. They opposed what they saw as the sexist status quo of the underground rock "boys' club", and made records that influenced 
many musicians that came after them. Examples of these bands are Bikini Kill, Huggy Bear, Bratmobile, Excuse 17, and Heavens to Betsy. They blended feminist politics with the D.I.Y. spirit of hardcore
punk. The Kill Rock Stars label was originally associated with this movement. Despite being misquoted and misrepresented in the mainstream media, these bands touched many lives and inspired women and men 
to start their own bands. In the mid-90's, Excuse 17 and Heavens to Betsy broke up. Excuse 17's Carrie Brownstein and Heavens to Betsy's Corin Tucker soon formed Sleater-Kinney, which rose to prominence in 
the late-90's and early-2000's.</p>


<h2>2000-Present</h2>

<p>If the 1990's was the "Alternative" decade, then the 2000's was the "Indie" decade. In the early part of the 2000's, a number of bands came onto the scene that were often designated as "post-punk
revival". Some of these bands were The Strokes, Interpol, The Vines, The Hives, and The White Stripes. These bands all varied in their sound, from smooth Velvet Underground-influenced rock, to noisy 
garage rock, to Joy Division-esque brooding pop rock. These bands came from such diverse places as New York City, Detroit, the UK, and Australia. Also, the Pacific Northwest played a large part
in the indie music scene of the late-90's and beyond. Highly acclaimed bands Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse were from Washington state, and Portland, Oregon produced many top-notch indie acts as well. While Portland was already known 
for bands such as Wipers and Poison Idea, during this time such artists as Sleater-Kinney(pictured), M. Ward, The Decemberists, and Elliott Smith emerged from the local music scene to make waves nationally. Elliott
Smith's death in 2003 shook the indie rock world, and his songwriting had even been complimented by famed pop artists Madonna and Celine Dion. Indie music continues to thrive today, with the Internet 
making it easier than ever to circumvent the corporate structure. As long as there is a demand for music produced by real people, not major labels, there will always be indie rock.</p>
