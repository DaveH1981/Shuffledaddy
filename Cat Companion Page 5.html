<h1>How to Care For Your Cat</h1>
<h2>Tips For Keeping Her Healthy and Happy</h2>
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;" id="sidebar">
Please be sure to spay or neuter your cat. This will help control the pet population as well as keep future cats from being euthanized.
</div>

<div id="box">
<h3>Keep Your Cat Safe</h3>
<div class="desc">
Help keep your feline companion safe by having her live indoors or otherwise safely confined to your home. If you choose
to take your cat outside for a walk, always use a leash with a collar and harness attached. Always use a cat carrier when you
are transporting your furry friend. Be sure to secure all window screens and close all appliances such as washers and dryers
when not in use. Following these tips will promote your cat's safety as well as give you peace of mind.
</div>

<h3>Give Your Cat ID</h3>
<div class="desc">
No matter how many precautions you take, there's always a chance that your cat could become lost. This is why it's important 
to give your cat an ID tag that fits on her collar. That way, she can be identified and you maximize the chances of her safe 
return home.
</div>

<h3>Take Your Cat to the Vet</h3>
<div class="desc">
Remember that a healthy pet is a happy pet. Your cat needs to be current on her shots as well as regular checkups to ensure
good health. If you don't know of a vet in your area, ask your local animal shelter, animal rescue group, or any friends or 
family members who have pets.
</div>

<h3>Provide Plenty of Food and Water</h3>
<div class="desc">
Make sure your cat has access to nutritious food and clean water at all times. It's a good idea to research what the
best kind of food is for your particular cat based on age, breed, activity level, etc.
</div>

<h3>Keep the Litter Box Clean</h3>
<div class="desc">
Cats are trained by their mothers to use a litter box when they are very young, so your cat should instinctively seek one out.
Be sure to scoop solid waste out once a day and change litter when needed. Also, place the litter box where the cat can easily
find it but it still gives her a measure of privacy.
</div>

<h3>Groom Your Cat Regularly</h3>
<div class="desc">
Have a high-quality brush on hand for grooming your cat's coat. Whether longhair or shorthair, all cats benefit from grooming,
as it results in less matting and fewer hairballs. Be certain that you trim your cats claws so that they don't grow into the
paw and cause her pain.
</div>

<h3>Bond With Your Cat</h3>
<div class="desc">
Although cats know how to entertain themselves, bonding is an essential part of cat companionship. Playing with your cat is 
therapeutic for you and your cat, and it strengthens the important bond both of you share. Make sure any toys introduced to
your cat are safe and age-appropriate. If your cat plays with catnip-infused toys, be sure to supervise her at all times.
