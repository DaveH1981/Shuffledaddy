<p>Welcome to my little corner of the Web. I have decided to dedicate a few pages to the independent rock music scene.
This genre of music, often called "indie rock", is very broad and encompasses a wide variety of styles and sounds. However, there
appears to be a couple of attributes that these artists tend to have in common. One is that they often choose to release their 
music on independent labels rather than the "Big Four" major labels(Sony, Capitol/EMI, Warner, Universal, and their subsidiaries).
Some prominent independent labels are: SST Records, Sub Pop, Kill Rock Stars, Merge, Matador, Touch & Go, 4AD, Rough Trade, and Dischord.
There are almost too many independent labels to count, but these are some of the most influential and recognizable in indie rock.</p>

<p>Another common thread among these artists is they tend to share a "D.I.Y.", or do-it-yourself, ethic. Instead of relying on radio 
airplay, having their videos shown on MTV, or corporate sponsorship, these artists work tirelessly to promote their music. This includes
selling their music online; making their own flyers for shows; keeping fans informed via social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, 
and ReverbNation; and promoting their records through relentless touring. These artists view themselves as existing outside the mainstream 
music corporate structure (Clear Channel, Live Nation, MTV, major record labels, et al.), and tend to eschew the pursuit of commercial 
success in order to focus on their musical artistry.</p> 

<p>This also tends to include forgoing "rockstar" flash for a more relaxed and casual 
aesthetic. In fact, some indie bands will stay at each other's homes while touring in order to save money. During the "golden era" of American
indie rock in the 80's, some band members still had to work day jobs such as an auto parts store clerk(D. Boon of Minutemen) and pizza chef(Bob Stinson 
of The Replacements) in order to pay all their bills. In fact, this was the case in 1984, when both Minutemen and The Replacements released their
masterpieces <em>Double Nickels on the Dime</em> and <em>Let it Be,</em> respectively. Both albums were so well-received that they found their way onto
<em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine's list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time." Clearly, this spartan approach is in stark contrast to the posh lifestyle 
of mainstream music's superstars.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this brief primer and you will stick around to explore the other areas of my site. Who knows, you just might discover your
new favorite band!</p>
