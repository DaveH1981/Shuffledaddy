        <em>Some things to consider before adopting a cat:</em>

        <h3>Make Sure Everyone Is On Board</h3>

        <p>If you live with your family, talk to them before adopting a cat. Make sure they understand the
        responsibility in caring for an animal and are willing to help out. In some cases, it may be helpful
        to make a chart that states who is responsible for what part of the cat's care. This way, everything
        is clear and there is no confusion. If you have roommates, be sure to check with them before getting
        a cat. If you rent, ask your landlord if you are unsure about whether cats are allowed.</p>

        <h3>Be Prepared</h3>

        <p>It is important to have the supplies you will need <strong>before</strong> the cat arrives. Some 
        basic items include:

        <ol>
	        <li id="oneList" class="list"><p><a href="#" onClick="expand('one'); return false"; onMouseOver="changeText(this); "OnMouseOut="changeTextBack(this);">A litter box with litter and cat pan liners</a></p></li>
	        <li id="oneList" class="list"><p><a href="#" onClick="expand('two'); return false"; onMouseOver="changeText(this); "OnMouseOut="changeTextBack(this);">Appropriate cat food plus food and water bowls</a></p></li>
	        <li id="oneList" class="list"><p><a href="#" onClick="expand('three'); return false"; onMouseOver="changeText(this); "OnMouseOut="changeTextBack(this);">Safe toys to keep your cat entertained</a></p></li>
	        <li id="oneList" class="list"><p><a href="#" onClick="expand('four'); return false"; onMouseOver="changeText(this); "OnMouseOut="changeTextBack(this);">A soft bed lined with a blanket or towel</a></p></li>
	        <li id="oneList" class="list"><p><a href="#" onClick="expand('five'); return false"; onMouseOver="changeText(this); "OnMouseOut="changeTextBack(this);">Grooming tools such as a good brush and nail clippers</a></p></li>
        <ol>

        <h3>Give Your Cat Her Space</h3>

        <p>Find a low-traffic room or area of your home and designate that as your cat's space. Arrange her food 
        and water bowls, litter box, and bed in an inviting manner. Scatter some cat toys around and clear out 
        nearby areas such as windowsills. This will help your cat feel welcome as she adjusts to her new home.</p>

        <h3>Take It Slow</h3>

        <p>When you first bring your new cat home, give her some alone time before you play with her. If you have
        other animals living in your home, wait a few days before introducing them to your cat. Even then, supervision
        is important when your cat is interacting with your other pets. Also, hold off on having other people meet your 
        cat until she is eating and going to the bathroom regularly. To aid in this, avoid changing your cat's food and 
        litter brands for the first few weeks or so. Even after this point, any change should be a slow transition from 
        one kind of food or litter to another.</p>

        <h3>Cat-Proof Your Home</h3>

        <p>Last but not least, please ensure that your home is reasonably free from hazards that could endanger your
        cat. Some examples of hazards are toxic houseplants, loose items that could be chewed or swallowed, and loose
        electrical wires. It is also helpful to keep items such as toilet paper, paper towels, and facial tissues out
        of the reach of your cat. This will help avoid a messy situation. For more information about plants, chemicals, and
        other items toxic to cats, please click on the links below.</p>
