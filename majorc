<p>Hopefully I've piqued your interest at least a little. Maybe you're even thinking, "Gee, this indie rock stuff is pretty interesting. I
would like more information." Well, you're in luck! Below I have assembled a list of links to various websites where you can find more info
on the topic, and a link to Amazon.com to buy <em>Our Band Could Be Your Life</em> by Michael Azerrad. Published in 2001, it is a terrific
glimpse into the American indie scene of the 1980's. Much of the information I know about the bands of this era came from reading this book.
Feel free to explore and enjoy.</p>
