What is this?
--------------------

This is an example of some of the webpages I have designed. Mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a little bit of PHP. Nothing fancy, but just to give an example of what I have designed. Included are a couple of basic sites I designed for a web development class in college as well as a personal homepage and a goofy joke page I coded in notepad while bored at work.
